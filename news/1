AN SIX917P RBG(s, m, k):
input: a random 64-bit seed s, integer m, and a DES EDE key k
output: m pseudorandom 64-bit strings x1 , x2 , ..., xm
1. compute I = Ek (D) where D is a 64-bit representation of the
date/time in as fine a resolution as possible.
2. for i = 1 to m do:
3.
xi = Ek (I ⊕ s)
4.
s = Ek (xi ⊕ I)
5. output (x1 , x2 , ..., xm )
This approach is a sound way to generate pseudorandom bits provided
that DES is replaced by a more modern cipher such as AES. Any pro-
grammer that employs this method for pseudorandom bit generation by
replacing DES with AES is employing a sound primitive.
